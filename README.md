# Quadratic-Equation-Solver

Here just for fun in a Python you can solve Quadratic Equation very easily :)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install numpy.

```bash
pip3 install numpy
```
The quadratic equation requires a square root, this is not automatically in normally python. Thatswhy  I need to import this sqrt function from the numpy module
## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
